# Personal Site

<https://brandon-j-nelson.com>

For sharing information related to work, publications, research, and recruiting.

Now using [Quarto](https://quarto.org)

## Updating, Adding Pages and Publishing

Currently locally compiling using `quarto render`, followed by a git commit and push to update the site as described as [Option 1 in the getting started guide for GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#render-to-docs)

Currently GitHub Pages defaults to resetting the url, so under Settings --> Pages --> Custom Url I need to reset it to my custom domain: brandon-j-nelson.com

## New Pages

1. on the transition to Quarto
2. on what is regulatory science and why work for the FDA
    - there remain many misconceptions about what FDA does, that we do research, and that researching at FDA you can still oublish, go to conferences, appy for grants and have many of the benefits of academia while being involed in important regulatory work and influencing the development of new safe and effective medical devices. It also offers unique insights into the medical device world by sitting at the intersection of industry, academia, and the clinic
    - give short blurb and summary if why FDA/what is reg sci on linkedin/x job posting

## TODO

- [ ] update publications (add links and summary pic)
- [ ] update presentations (both^ reflecting the public work on my internal sight)
- [ ] update CV
- [ ] add 'new pages'

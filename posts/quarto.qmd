This site has moved to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) from [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), originally recommended for blogging by [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/), here's a [discussion on why](https://forums.fast.ai/t/fastpages-deprecating-fastpages-in-favor-of-quarto/99095)

Below is some example Quarto from their tutorial to show off some functionality

## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more
- Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
import os
os.cpu_count()
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
